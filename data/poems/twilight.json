        "Silent lightning strikes and I think of her.",
        "Naught stirs the stillness; no rain dares to fall.",
        "Deep within the lifeless quiet, she calls.",
        "As the wind passes, through empty spaces,",
        "Her soft, hollow song through my heart races.",
        "She is my yearning; she is the absence",
        "I taste in the bitterness of substance.",
        "The sky looms large and light flashes above;",
        "No thunder reverbs like the throes of love.",
        "Only the dew which gathers on my skin",
        "Reminds me I once felt, and may again."
