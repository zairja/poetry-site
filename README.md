# Poetry Site
This repo is forked from [this project](https://github.com/netlify-templates/next-platform-starter).

The simplicity of this site/app means you could probably make it from scratch, then bring in Netlify-specific code.

I took the easy route (rip out stuff I don't need).

# Roadmap:
* Serving poem text dynamically - **Complete** âœ…
* Cookie support
* Text removal based on cookie
